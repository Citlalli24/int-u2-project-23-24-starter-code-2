        attacked by people then people who are not asian and this is because they are being accused of starting the
        COVID-19 virus. Asian hate can lead to many different harmful things. For exmaple people can get phuysically,
        mentally, and emotionally hurt.

      <p>There are many ways to prevent the spread of Asian hate. Such as talking to people who are Asian if you see
        them getting harrased or spoken down too. Also not hating on them because although everyone is different in
        there own way we are all people and we all have feelings and emotions. Also if you are Asian you should try to
        speak up for yourself and try to stand up for yourself or just walk away and be unbothered. There are also other
        ways to fight back for example protesting is a peacful way to fight back without hurting people and convincing
        people to join the protest instead.
